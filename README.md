# Hi, I'm Talha Imtiaz! 👋

I'm currently working as a **DevOps Engineer at Carbonteq**, where I work with **Kubernetes, autoscaling, and cloud/on-prem server deployments**. I love solving infrastructure challenges, automating workflows, and building systems that scale reliably.

Apart from DevOps, I also work on **full-stack development** projects using **React** and **Python**. I enjoy building smart, user-friendly apps — including **Robin Relay**, an SRE agent built with **n8n automation** and **Agentic AI**, and a **CASA web app** for an international client.

Would you like me to make this version more **graphical and interactive** (with badges, visitor counter, or GitHub stats cards)? It would make your profile look more professional and dynamic.
